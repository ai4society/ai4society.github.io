# description: "**NEW!** Our paper that presents a novel system to recommend teams using a variety of AI methods has been accepted to [**_IAAI-AAAI'2024_**](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/iaai-24-call-for-participation/) and will receive the *Innovative Application* award.
description: "We present an AI-based system to aid in team formation for researchers responding to funding agency proposals. Our approach leverages NLP techniques to extract and normalize technical skills from various data sources, facilitating matching and teaming based on constraints. We have gathered initial feedback from university researchers to deploy the prototype system and published a dataset for broader use. [More Details](https://ai4society.github.io/teaming/)"
# description: "We introduce an emerging AI-based approach and prototype system for assisting team formation when researchers respond to calls for proposals from funding agencies. This is an instance of the general problem of building teams when demand opportunities come periodically and potential members may vary over time. The novelties of our approach are that we: (a) extract technical skills needed about researchers and calls from multiple data sources and normalize them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, (b) build a prototype solution based on matching and teaming based on constraints, (c) describe initial feedback about system from researchers at a University to deploy, and (d) create and publish a dataset that others can use.
