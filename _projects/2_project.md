description: "The newly introduced idea of fast and slow AI envisages a multi-agent AI architecture where incoming problems are solved by either system 1 (or ”fast” - S1) agents, also called solvers, that react by exploiting only past experience, or by system 2 (or ”slow” - S2) agents, that are deliberately activated when there is the need to reason and search for optimal solutions beyond what is expected from the system 1 agent (AAAI 2021). "
