title: Planning Using Fast and Slow AI Architecture  
team: "University of South Carolina, IBM Research, University of Udine, University of Brescia"  
description: "The newly introduced idea of Fast and Slow AI (SOFA) architecture is inspired from the cognitive theories mentioned by Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow. We adapt the SOFAI architecture to solving planning domains where incoming problems are solved by either system 1 (or ”fast” - S1) agents, also called solvers, that react by exploiting either past experience or using a learnt model, or by system 2 (or ”slow” - S2) agents, that are deliberately activated when there is the need to reason and search for optimal solutions beyond what is expected from the system 1 agent."
