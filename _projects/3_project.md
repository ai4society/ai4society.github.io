title: Planning Using Fast and Slow AI Architecture  
team: "University of South Carolina, IBM Research, University of Udine, University of Brescia"  
description: "The newly introduced idea of Fast and Slow AI (SOFAI) architecture is inspired from the cognitive theories mentioned by Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow. This research project aims to build AI-supported machines that can 1) make decisions with emergent behaviors similar to the human ones and 2) support human decision making through nudging and explanations. To achieve these goals, the team is designing and building a cognitive architecture (SOFAI, see below) to mimic these two broad modalities in a machine.

We adapt the SOFAI architecture to solving planning domains where incoming problems are solved by either system 1 (or ”fast” - S1) agents, also called solvers, that react by exploiting either past experience (case-based reasoning) or using a learnt model called as Plansformer, or by system 2 (or ”slow” - S2) agents, that are deliberately activated when there is the need to reason and search for optimal solutions beyond what is expected from the system 1 agent. SOFAI architecture with Plansformer as S1 solves more problems than the symbolic planner (FastDownward, which is also used as S2).
