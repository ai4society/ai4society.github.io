description: "Rubikâ€™s Cube (RC) is a popular puzzle that is also computationally hard to solve. In this demonstration, we introduce the first PDDL formulation for the 3-dimension RC and solve it with off-the-shelf Fast-Downward planner. We also create a plan executor and visualizer to show how the plan achieves the intended goal. Our system has two audiences:(a) planning researchers who can explore a hard problem, and (b) RC learners wanting to learn how to solve the puzzle at their own pace.

# description: "We introduce an emerging AI-based approach and prototype system for assisting team formation when researchers respond to calls for proposals from funding agencies. This is an instance of the general problem of building teams when demand opportunities come periodically and potential members may vary over time. The novelties of our approach are that we: (a) extract technical skills needed about researchers and calls from multiple data sources and normalize them using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, (b) build a prototype solution based on matching and teaming based on constraints, (c) describe initial feedback about system from researchers at a University to deploy, and (d) create and publish a dataset that others can use.
