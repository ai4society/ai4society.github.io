team: "Kausik Lakkaraju, Biplav Srivastava, Marco Valtorta"  
description: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems like facial recognition systems and sentiment 
analyzers are known to exhibit model uncertainty which can be perceived as 
algorithmic bias in most cases (esp. in the presence of protected attributes like 
gender and race). This line of work aims to examine and, if possible, mitigate the 
bias in AI systems by establishing causal relationships. Based on this, we would 
assign a rating to the AI system, which helps the user make an informed selection 
when choosing different systems for their application."
