description: "AI systems, such as facial recognition and sentiment analyzers, often show model uncertainty, leading to algorithmic bias, particularly concerning protected attributes like gender and race. This research seeks to understand and reduce bias by establishing causal relationships. Assigning ratings to AI systems based on this helps users make informed choices.

# description: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems like facial recognition systems and sentiment 
# analyzers are known to exhibit model uncertainty which can be perceived as 
# algorithmic bias in most cases (esp. in the presence of protected attributes like 
# gender and race). This line of work aims to examine and, if possible, mitigate the 
# bias in AI systems by establishing causal relationships. Based on this, we would 
# assign a rating to the AI system, which helps the user make an informed selection 
# when choosing different systems for their application. [More Details](https://ai4society.github.io/rating_page/)"
