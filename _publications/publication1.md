DOI={10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21722}, abstractNote={Modern artificial intelligence 
(AI) methods have been used to solve problems that many humans struggle to 
solve. This opens up new opportunities for knowledge discovery and education. We 
demonstrate ALLURE, an educational AI system for learning to solve the Rubik’s 
cube that is designed to help students improve their problem solving skills. ALLURE 
can both find and explain its own strategies for solving the Rubik’s cube as well as 
build on user-provided strategies. Collaboration between AI and user happens using 
visual and natural language modalities.}, number={11}, journal={Proceedings of

abstract="In this demonstration, we focus on middleware data obtained from 
devices like the network routers and power meters which may be of interest to a 
technician fixing a customer complaint or a user trying to self-diagnose their utility 
usage. The users in our case are often unaware of both the data details and 
database querying language which is in contrast to typical natural language to 
structured query (NL2SQL) situations where the business analyst knows their 
domain data but not the querying techniques. We adapt the rule-based NL2SQL 
approach to our problem and in particular, focus on queries about users, devices 
and spatio-temporal properties that are unique to this setting. We demonstrate an 
Alexa-based system, implemented using open-source Rasa, that can answer router 
usage queries in a home setting and easily extended for power usage or other 
utilities.",
