            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>On the internet, where the number of available choices is exponentially growing, there is a need to
                prioritize and efficiently deliver relevant results to users, on demand. Recommendation systems (RSs)
                address this need by searching and filtering through large amounts of dynamically generated information
                and providing users with recommendations tailored to them. These systems have primarily focused on (1)
                single-user models, where recommendations are tailored towards a specific individual, or (2) single-item
                models, where items are recommended based on a broader appeal to users and similarities in item
                metadata, in the past. In many real-world scenarios, however, recommendation systems are often tailored
                to groups of users rather than individual users. This shift from single-user and towards group
                recommendation brings forth unique challenges such as addressing the diverse needs of a group, resolving
                conflicts and reaching consensus, assuring that groups receive fair recommendations without bias towards
                protected characteristics such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status; and ensuring that
                recommendations remain stable and adaptable even in response to dynamic and evolving environments. Such
                systems are growing increasingly relevant in disciplines such as team management, healthcare, online
                communities, and entertainment.</p>
            <p>This dissertation explores and addresses the unique challenges of group recommendation systems (GRSs),
                such as increased computational complexity, varying group dynamics, and principles of trustworthy
                artificial intelligence (AI) related to bias, fairness, and robustness. The research makes contributions
                towards developing novel methods and metrics for GRSs, evaluating them with respect to performance
                through real-world case studies, such as team formation (project management) and meal planning
                (healthcare), and improving fairness and robustness of group recommendations. For team recommendation,
                the built system, called ULTRA, has been evaluated to demonstrate its effectiveness and generality in
                the context of research funding at academic institutions in the United States (US) and India. This work
                releases comprehensive datasets to aid in developing adaptable and reliable GRSs that optimize both
                performance and user satisfaction in dynamic environments. Beyond research, the dissertation is opening
                new avenues in entrepreneurship, intellectual property, and teaching resources.</p>
