abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems like facial recognition systems and sentiment analyzers are known to exhibit model uncertainty which can be perceived as algorithmic bias in most cases. The aim of my Ph.D. is to examine and control the bias present in these AI systems by establishing causal relationships and also assigning a rating to these systems, which helps the user to make an informed selection when choosing from different systems for their application.},
