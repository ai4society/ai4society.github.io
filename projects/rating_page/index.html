                Foundation Models (FMs) have improved time series forecasting in various sectors, such as finance, but their vulnerability to input disturbances can hinder their 
                adoption by stakeholders, such as investors and analysts. To address this, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to study the robustness of Foundational 
                Models for Time Series (FMTS) with respect to input perturbations. We evaluate our approach to the stock price prediction problem, a well-studied problem with 
                easily accessible public data, evaluating six state-of-the-art (some multi-modal) FMTS across six prominent stocks spanning three industries. The ratings 
                proposed by our framework effectively assess the robustness of FMTS and also offer actionable insights for model selection and deployment. Within the scope of 
                our study, we find that (1) multi-modal FMTS exhibit better robustness and accuracy compared to their uni-modal versions and, (2) FMTS pre-trained on time series 
                forecasting task exhibit better robustness and forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose FMTS pre-trained across diverse settings. Further, to validate our 
                framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing FMTS prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirmed that our ratings reduced the 
                difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different systems.

                AI systems are notorious for their fragility; minor input changes can potentially cause major output swings. When such systems are deployed 
                in critical areas like finance, the consequences of their uncertain behavior could be severe. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal 
                time-series forecasting, where imprecision due to noisy or incorrect data can lead to erroneous predictions, impacting stakeholders such 
                as analysts, investors, and traders. Recently, it has been shown that beyond numeric data, graphical transformations can be used with 
                \advanced visual models to achieve better performance. In this context, we introduce a rating methodology to assess the robustness of 
                Multi-Modal Time-Series Forecasting Models (MM-TSFM) through causal analysis, which helps us understand and quantify the isolated impact 
                of various attributes on the forecasting accuracy of MM-TSFM. We apply our novel rating method on a variety of numeric and multi-modal 
                forecasting models in a large experimental setup (six input settings of control and perturbations, ten data distributions, time series from 
                six leading stocks in three industries over a year of data, and five time-series forecasters) to draw insights on robust forecasting models 
                and the context of their strengths. Within the scope of our study, our main result is that multi-modal (numeric + visual) forecasting, which 
                was found to be more accurate than numeric forecasting in previous studies, can also be more robust in diverse settings. Our work will help 
                different stakeholders of time-series forecasting understand the models` behaviors along trust (robustness) and accuracy dimensions to select 
                an appropriate model for forecasting using our rating method, leading to improved decision-making.

              We introduce ARC, a tool to rate AI systems for bias through a causal lens. 
              The main objective of the tool is to assist developers in building better models 
              and aid end-users in making informed decisions based on the available data. 
              The tool is extensible and currently supports three different AI tasks: binary classification, 
              sentiment analysis, and group recommendation. It gives users the option of choosing data 
              for a task and rating AI systems for bias with respect to different protected attributes 
              present in the data. The rating method is system-independent and the ratings given by 
              the algorithm are causally interpretable. These ratings help the user make an informed 
              decision based on the data in hand. The demonstration video is available here:<br>

                Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that 
                assign one or more numbers to convey the polarity and emotional intensity of a given piece of 
                text. However, like other automatic machine learning systems, SASs can exhibit model uncertainty, 
                resulting in drastic swings in output with even small changes in input. This issue becomes more 
                problematic when inputs involve protected attributes like gender or race, as it can be perceived 
                as bias or unfairness. To address this, we propose a novel method to assess and rate SASs. 
                We perturb inputs in a controlled causal setting to test if the output sentiment is sensitive 
                to protected attributes while keeping other components of the textual input, such as chosen
                emotion words, fixed. Based on the results, we assign labels (ratings) at both fine-grained and 
                overall levels to indicate the robustness of the SAS to input changes. The ratings can help 
                decision-makers improve online content by reducing hate speech, often fueled by biases related 
                to protected attributes such as gender and race. These ratings provide a principled basis for
                comparing SASs and making informed choices based on their behavior. The ratings also benefit 
                all users, especially developers who reuse off-the-shelf SASs to build larger AI systems but 
                do not have access to their code or training data to compare.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that output polarity and
              emotional intensity when given a piece of text as input. Like
              other AIs, SASs are also known to have unstable behavior when
              subjected to changes in data which can make them problematic
              to trust out of concerns like bias when AI works with humans and
              data has protected attributes like gender, race, and age. Recently,
              an approach was introduced to assess SASs in a blackbox setting
              without training data or code, and rating them for bias using
              synthetic English data. We augment it by introducing two 
              human-generated chatbot datasets and also considering a round-trip
              setting of translating the data from one language to the same
              through an intermediate language. We find that these settings
              show SASs performance in a more realistic light. Specifically,
              we find that rating SASs on the chatbot data showed more bias
              compared to the synthetic data, and round-tripping using Spanish
              and Danish as intermediate languages reduces the bias (up to
              68% reduction) in human-generated data while, in synthetic data,
              it takes a surprising turn by increasing the bias! Our findings
              will help researchers and practitioners refine their SAS testing
              strategies and foster trust as SASs are considered part of more
              mission-critical applications for global use.

              AI services are known to have unstable behavior when subjected to changes in data, models or users. 
              Such behaviors, whether triggered by omission or commission, lead to trust issues when AI works with humans. 
              The current approach of assessing AI services in a black box setting, where the consumer does not have access to the AI's source code or training data, is limited. 
              The consumer has to rely on the AI developer's documentation and trust that the system has been built as stated. Further, if the AI consumer reuses the service to build other services which they sell to their customers, the consumer is at the risk of the service providers (both data and model providers). 
              Our approach, in this context, is inspired by the success of nutritional labeling in food industry to promote health and seeks to assess and rate AI services for trust from the perspective of an independent stakeholder. 
              The ratings become a means to communicate the behavior of AI systems so that the consumer is informed about the risks and can make an informed decision. 
              In this paper, we will first describe recent progress in developing rating methods for text-based machine translator AI services that have been found promising with user studies. 
              Then, we will outline challenges and vision for a principled, multi-modal, causality-based rating methodologies and its implication for decision-support in real-world scenarios like health and food recommendation.

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems like facial recognition systems and sentiment analyzers are known to exhibit model uncertainty which can be perceived as algorithmic bias in most cases. 
                The aim of my Ph.D. is to examine and control the bias present in these AI systems by establishing causal relationships and also assigning a rating to these systems, 
                which helps the user to make an informed selection when choosing from different systems for their application.

              Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that assign a score conveying the sentiment and
              emotion intensity when a piece of text is given as input. Like other AI, and especially machine learning (ML) based systems, they have
              also exhibited instability in their values when inputs are perturbed with respect to gender and race, which can be interpreted as biased
              behavior. In this demonstration paper, we present ROSE, a resource for understanding the behavior of SAS systems with respect to
              gender. It consists of data consisting of input text and output sentiment scores and a visualization tool to explore the behavior of SAS.
              We calculated the output sentiment scores using off-the-shelf SASs and our deep-learning-based implementations based on published
              architectures. ROSE, created using the d3.js framework, is publicly available here for easy access.

            This tutorial explores the evaluation and rating of AI systems for trust, specifically focusing on financial applications. 
            As AI technologies increasingly rely on correlational data, their black-box nature becomes a problem in high-stakes domains 
            such as finance, where errors can have severe implications. We will discuss the rating method which is used to make the 
            system behavior transparent. Building on previous research, this tutorial will particularly discuss our novel causal 
            analysis-based approach to rate different black-box AI systems for bias and robustness. This tutorial aims to equip 
            stakeholders with the necessary tools to verify and choose AI systems that demonstrate real-world reliability and 
            robustness under various conditions.

            A method and system relates to assigning ratings (i.e., labels) to convey the trustability of AI systems grounded 
            in its cause-and-effect behavior of significant inputs and outputs of the AI. Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are 
            data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that, given a piece of text, assign a score conveying the sentiment 
            and emotion intensity. The present disclosure uses the approach that protected attributes like gender and race 
            influence the output (sentiment) given by SASs or if the sentiment is based on other components of the textual input, 
            e.g., chosen emotion words. The presently disclosed rating methodology assigns ratings at fine-grained and overall 
            levels, to rate SASs grounded in a causal setup, and provides an open-source implementation of both SASs—two 
            deep-learning based, one lexicon-based, and two custom-built models—for this rating implementation. This allows users 
            to understand the behavior of SAS in real-world applications.
